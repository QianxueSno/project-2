          <h1>1<br>for us, vision is always a problem.<br>
how do we perceive our reality?

we have difficulty describing our lived reality. held in a small corner of life, we even fail to recognize what our reality is really like. but the differences between our realities cannot be denied.
yours, mine, the worker’s, the office worker’s, the bus driver’s, and the cashier’s. <br>

drink the water.<br>
ignite the cigarette.<br>
do the work.<br>
and wait in this little moment. </br>
our realities are round and square, with some bits of inner chaos and self-contradiction.  </br> </br>

2 </br>
we must admit that our little worlds always have boundaries.  </br>
when we walk across an overpass or zebra crossing, passing through the perilous inner body of the city, is the boundary of our reality stretching and the field of our vision expanding?　 </br>the city doesn’t run on its own.  </br>it needs people.  </br>many kinds of people. the rich and the poor, the capital and the labor. Many kinds of realities co-exist here.

 </br>the city, the village in the city, the window of the world, and the manhattan city in the middle of that shallow artificial ditch.  </br>we strive to zoom in, to amplify this one "shared reality”. we try to focus. but for us, vision is always a problem.

 </br>time cannot be shared in a true sense, and the spaces taken by our realities always overlap and entangle with each other. in this precarious city, people go their own ways, but they spread anxiety and beliefs, contaminating other people through the clashing of their realities’ boundaries.

 </br>the city we share has its own call, but for each of us, our visions are not the same.
 </br>
with our limited visions, how do we recognize our realities?</h1>
