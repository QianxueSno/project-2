            <p>having been stuck in the states since the lockdown in march, 2020, i work on this thesis project about shenzhen with every relevant material I have at hand. the lack of materials requires me to look and work more closely with what i have, and also pushes me to look for alternative ways of thinking and understanding pieces of realities i encountered and collected. there are a lot of things i hope to express through this project, but there are two complicated and elusive for me to address at once. i consider my thesis project as some kind of growing anthology. every piece included in this project needs to be self-sustained on its own, but when everything comes together, i hope they will build a bigger narrative, and show the audience something closer to the intricate and interconnected realities i know in shenzhen.

          <br>
chapter 1   &nbsp&nbsp what are the missing parts?
<p>in the summer of 2018, i interned at shenzhen tv station. running around in the city with two reporters everyday, we covered local stories for the broadcast and the newspaper. one might expect news stories to be always extraordinary and thrilling, but the reality was, most stories presented in the local news were insignificant and boring. for example, a metro security guard returned a suitcase that had 10 thousands RMB cash in it to Mr z, who was going back to his hometown after years working as a construction worker in the city. or, a successful female entrepreneur d established her company of shared bikes in 5 years and benefited the local communities. That was how shenzhen felt to me initially--the fastest developing city in the world was always on the go, composed of thousands of insignificant little out-of-sync pieces of realities. i failed to understand anything from these small pieces of lives in the city and was disappointed by the job, but then i came across one story that allowed me to see and understand these seemingly abnormal but irrelevant realities. <br><br>

  the story took place in lychee park in futian district. in early June, the lychee trees in the park started to fruit. the trees had dry and crisp branches and broke easily, and for that reason, picking lychees was formally prohibited by the park. but people at the time were sneaking into the park at night to steal lychees, and many of them were severely injured and hospitalized after their attempts. At the park, we investigated the gigantic lychee trees that people fell from. they were at least three-floors tall and looked bizarre and demonic with their thick and curvy branches. such creatures were somewhat out-of-place for shenzhen, a city where every part was carefully devised.<br><br>

  at the security office of the park, we were presented with a pile of printed phone photos the security guards took of people in action or being caught. among all the low-quality phone photos, one strangely composed photo caught my eyes. made up of low resolution bits, the photo renders a mysterious tableau where three misty figures appear in the dark. a woman in purple floral dress is sitting cross-leg on the ground and looking down at a pile of branches in her arms; a middle-age man in a striped shirt is standing on her left, having his hands clasped behind his back and looking at the woman indifferently; at the heart of the darkness in the far background, a dim little figure is looking at the scene with his arms crossed. What is going on here? if one is told that someone in this scene tried to steal lychees but some terrible things happened to them, then the question becomes only more frustrating. what is missing here? the lychees? The victim? the broken bone? or something else?
